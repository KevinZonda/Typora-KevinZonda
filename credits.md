**鸣谢**

本项目是在Keldos的基础上完成的：  

[@Keldos-Li](https://github.com/Keldos-Li) [Keldos-Li/typora-latex-theme](https://github.com/Keldos-Li/typora-latex-theme?tab=readme-ov-file) 

> 1. 参考`四川大学本科毕业论文（设计）格式和参考文献著录要求`，修改了字体、样式、大小
> 2. 修改任务列表、代码块、行内代码、引用块样式
> 3. 二级及以下标题全部靠左，适应文章样式；后面加上大空白，适配LaTeX样式
> 4. 取消了页面阴影
